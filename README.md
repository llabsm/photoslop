**Model:** Anthropic Claude Opus 4.6
**Stack:** React + TypeScript + Vite + Fabric.js v6

## The Prompt

> Build a professional-grade, browser-based image editing web application with the following complete feature set:
>
> **Core Architecture**
>
> - Canvas-based rendering engine (use Fabric.js or Konva.js, or raw HTML5 Canvas)
> - Non-destructive editing via a layer system with blend modes, opacity, and visibility toggles
> - Full undo/redo history stack (at least 50 steps)
> - Support for opening and exporting PNG, JPEG, WebP, and SVG files
>
> **Tonal & Color Adjustments**
>
> - Exposure, brightness, contrast, highlights, and shadows sliders
> - White balance / color temperature and tint
> - Hue, saturation, luminance (HSL) controls per color channel
> - Vibrance and clarity
> - Curves editor (RGB and per-channel)
> - Levels histogram with black/white/midpoint input
> - Color grading panel (shadows, midtones, highlights wheels)
>
> **Retouching & Healing Tools**
>
> - Clone stamp tool
> - Healing brush (blend surrounding pixels)
> - Spot removal tool
> - Liquify tool (push, pull, warp, bloat, pucker)
>
> **Selection & Masking**
>
> - Rectangular and elliptical marquee selection
> - Lasso and polygonal lasso
> - Magic wand (tolerance-based fill selection)
> - Quick mask mode
> - Layer masking (paint to reveal/hide)
> - Feathering and edge refinement on selections
>
> **Compositing & Layers**
>
> - Layer panel with drag-to-reorder, grouping, and locking
> - Full set of blend modes: Normal, Multiply, Screen, Overlay, Soft Light, Hard Light, Difference, Color, Luminosity, etc.
> - Smart object support (embed and transform without quality loss)
> - Adjustment layers (non-destructive, affect layers below)
> - Clipping masks
>
> **Filters & Effects**
>
> - Gaussian, motion, and radial blur
> - Sharpen and unsharp mask
> - Noise reduction and grain
> - Lens distortion correction (barrel, pincushion)
> - Vignette
> - Artistic filters (pixelate, posterize, emboss)
>
> **Text & Vector Tools**
>
> - Text tool with full typography controls (font, size, tracking, leading, kerning, color)
> - Vector pen tool for custom paths
> - Basic shape tools (rectangle, ellipse, polygon, line)
> - Path editing and stroke/fill controls
>
> **Transform Tools**
>
> - Free transform (scale, rotate, skew, distort, perspective)
> - Crop tool with ratio presets and straighten
> - Flip horizontal/vertical
> - Canvas resize and image resize (with interpolation options)
>
> **Painting & Drawing**
>
> - Brush tool with size, hardness, opacity, and flow controls
> - Brush presets and custom brush shapes
> - Eraser tool (hard and soft)
> - Gradient tool (linear, radial, angle, reflected)
> - Paint bucket / fill tool
> - Color picker with hex, RGB, and HSL input
> - Eyedropper tool
>
> **UI & UX**
>
> - Dark-themed, panel-based layout similar to professional creative software
> - Collapsible left toolbar, right panel dock (layers, adjustments, history, properties)
> - Top menu bar with File, Edit, Image, Layer, Filter, View menus
> - Zoom and pan with mousewheel and hand tool
> - Rulers and guides
> - Responsive to large desktop screens
>
> **Export & Output**
>
> - Export as PNG, JPEG (with quality slider), WebP
> - Flatten to single layer for export
> - Copy merged to clipboard
>
> Use vanilla JS with HTML5 Canvas, or React with a canvas library — whichever produces the cleanest architecture. Prioritize performance for large images. Structure the codebase modularly so each tool and panel is its own component or module.
